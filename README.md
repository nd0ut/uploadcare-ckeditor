## Install

Youâ€™re free to choose from the install methods listed below.

### Automatic install

Simply add the [File Uploader plugin][ck-uc-plugin] to [CKBuilder][ck-docs-online-builder].

You can find more information in the [CKBuilder docs][ck-docs-auto-install].

### Manual install

Download the latest plugin archive from the [release branch][release-branch]
or [releases page][releases-page].

Extract the downloaded plugin into the plugins folder of your CKEditor installation.

Also you can clone repository:

```
git clone -b release git@github.com:uploadcare/uploadcare-ckeditor.git plugins/uploadcare
```

Or just load it in your page:

```javascript
CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal('uploadcare', '/absolute/path/to/uploadcare/plugin.js')
```

You can find more info on manually installing plugins in the [CKEditor docs][ck-docs-manual-install].

## Usage

Add `uploadcare` to your list of CKEditor plugins and toolbar.
**Set your [public key][widget-docs-options-public-key]**. 

```
CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {
  extraPlugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: [['Uploadcare', /* Your toolbar items */]],
  uploadcare: {publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'},
})
```

## Configuration

Initialize a plugin with additional options:

```javascript
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'ru' // set locale if you wish

CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {
  extraPlugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: [['Uploadcare', /* Your toolbar items */]],
  uploadcare: {
    publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
    multiple: true,
    crop: '1:1,4:3',
  },
})
```

You can deeply customize the widget behavior: file sources, file validation, and much more.
