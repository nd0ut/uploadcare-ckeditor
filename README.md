## Demo

Check out the basic demo [here][ck-demo].

## Requirements

CKEditor 4.0+ (not 5).

File Uploader for CKEditor v5 is on its way. Stay tuned.

## Install

You can go with either [automatic](#install-auto) or [manual](install-manual)
install.

### Automatic install

Just add the [File Uploader][ck-uc-plugin] plugin to your
[CKBuilder][ck-docs-online-builder].

You can find more info in the [CKBuilder docs][ck-docs-auto-install].

### Manual install

Download the latest plugin archive from the
[release branch][github-release-branch] or [releases page][github-release-page].

Extract the downloaded archive to the plugin directory of your CKEditor
installation.

Other options here are either cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone -b release git@github.com:uploadcare/uploadcare-ckeditor.git plugins/uploadcare
```

Or directly loading it in your page:

```javascript
CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal('uploadcare', '/absolute/path/to/uploadcare/plugin.js')
```

You can find more info on manually installing plugins in the
[CKEditor docs][ck-docs-manual-install].

## Usage

Add `uploadcare` to the list of your CKEditor plugins and the toolbar.
**Set your [public key][uc-widget-docs-option-public-key]**. Public keys are
used to identify a target Uploadcare [project][uc-projects] your uploads will
go to.

```
CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {
  extraPlugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: [['Uploadcare', /* Your toolbar items */]],
  uploadcare: {publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'},
})
```

## Configuration

### Plugin configuration

To apply a custom configuration, initialize the plugin providing additional
options:

```javascript
UPLOADCARE_LOCALE = 'ru' // set a preferred locale if needed

CKEDITOR.replace('editor', {
  extraPlugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: [['Uploadcare', /* your toolbar items */]],
  uploadcare: {
    publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY', // set your public API key here
    multiple: true, // allow multi-file uploads
    crop: '1:1,4:3', // set crop options when handling images
    /* feel free to add more “object key” options here */
  },
})
```

### Widget configuration

Uploadcare Widget can be deeply customized to suit your UX/UI. You can define
allowed upload sources, implement file validation, and more.

Use our live [widget sandbox][uc-widget-configure] as a starting point and consider
checking out the docs on [widget configuration][uc-widget-docs-config] and its
[JavaScript API][uc-widget-docs-js-api].
